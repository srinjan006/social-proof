# Blockchain-based Social Proof System

## Project Title
Blockchain-based Social Proof System

## Project Description
This project aims to create a decentralized social proof mechanism where users can earn and maintain verified reputations using blockchain technology. Reputation points are stored on the blockchain, ensuring transparency, security, and immutability.
